# 🎵 Spotify Song Clustering & Popularity Prediction

A Machine Learning project that clusters songs based on their audio features and predicts their popularity using supervised learning. Built with Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of Spotify tracks, aiming to:

- Group similar songs together using **unsupervised learning (KMeans Clustering)**
- Predict a song’s **popularity score** using **supervised learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest)**
- Visualize data trends and model performance

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand music features through data visualization
- Cluster songs by vibe/genre using unsupervised learning
- Predict popularity score based on track characteristics
- Make it accessible and understandable to non-technical users
